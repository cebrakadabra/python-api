## Python REST API
with Django REST Framework

## How to get the Django REST Framework

pip install markdown       # Markdown support for the browsable API.
pip install django-filter  # Filtering support
```

### Development Notes
- simple api with one endpoint named snippets finished
- API which follows the DRY concept
- using class based views, rather than function based views
- using generic class based views (lot of code reduce!)
- added authentication
